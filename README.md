# Developer Portfolio - Dual Experience Website

An innovative TypeScript Next.js portfolio featuring two distinct user experiences: a traditional resume format and an immersive 3-stage interactive journey. This project demonstrates modern web development skills while showcasing my transition to becoming an AI-native software engineer.

## üéØ Project Philosophy

This portfolio serves dual purposes:

1. **Showcase frontend engineering expertise** through clean architecture, performance optimization, and innovative UI/UX design
2. **Demonstrate AI-native development approach** by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as development accelerators while maintaining human oversight of critical decisions

### AI-Aided Development Approach

This project comprehensively utilizes AI/LLM services throughout the development process:

**AI Contributions:**

- ü§ñ Boilerplate code generation and initial component structures
- ü§ñ Basic layout implementations and styling foundations
- ü§ñ Documentation generation and code comments
- ü§ñ Test case scaffolding and utility functions
- ü§ñ Performance optimization suggestions

**Human-Driven Core Responsibilities:**

- üß† **Architecture decisions** - System design, component relationships, data flow
- üß† **Main application flow** - User experience design, interaction patterns
- üß† **Code quality assurance** - Clean code principles, maintainability, scalability
- üß† **Technical leadership** - Library selection, performance strategies, accessibility
- üß† **Creative vision** - Unique features like mathematical ASCII 3D rendering

> _"An AI-native software engineer is one who deeply integrates AI into their daily workflow, treating it as a partner to amplify their abilities."_ - Inspired by [Addie Osmani's vision of AI-native development](https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-ai-native-software-engineer)

## üöÄ Dual Portfolio Experience

### 1. Plain Resume Version

Traditional portfolio with professional presentation:

- Hero section with personal introduction
- About section with detailed background
- Skills showcase with technical abilities
- Projects portfolio with descriptions and links
- Experience timeline with work history
- Contact section with form and social links

### 2. Interactive Movie-like Experience

Innovative 3-stage immersive journey:

#### Stage 1: JSON Data Display

- Interactive JSON viewer/editor showcasing personal data
- Syntax highlighting and real-time editing capabilities
- Search and filter functionality within data structure

#### Stage 2: CLI Terminal Experience

- Terminal-style interface with typing animations
- **Mathematical ASCII 3D rotating cube rendering** (showcasing graphics programming)
- Real-time matrix transformations and vertex projection
- Interactive commands and career timeline presentation
- Loading sequences with personal trivia

#### Stage 3: 3D Human Figure Visualization

- Human-shaped figure composed of color-coded information cubes
- Interactive 3D controls with WebGL/Three.js rendering
- Click/hover interactions revealing detailed information
- Advanced graphics programming demonstration
